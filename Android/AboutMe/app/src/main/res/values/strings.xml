    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Arvind.
\n\nI love fish.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n
A ScrollView is a view group that allows the view hierarchy placed within it to be scrolled. \n
        A scroll view can contain only one other view, or view group, as a child. The child view is commonly a LinearLayout. Inside a LinearLayout, you can add other views.\n \n
