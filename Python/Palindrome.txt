Q. For a given positive number num, identify the palindrome formed by performing the following operations-
  >Add num and its reverse
  >Check whether the sum is palindrome or not. If not, add the sum and its reverse and repeat the process until a palindrome is obtained.
  
For Example:
If original integer is 195, we get 9339 as the resulting palindrome after the fourth addition.

My Solution:
Python 3.0

num=int(input())
temp=num
def palin(r):
    c=0
    rev=0
    while(r>0):
        c=r%10
        rev=rev*10+c 
        r=r//10
    return rev 
def addall(r1,r2):
    c=0 
    c=r1+r2
    return c 
flag=0 
ra=num 
while(flag!=1):
    ra=palin(ra)
    ra=addall(ra,temp)
    if(ra==palin(ra)):
        flag=1 
    else:
        temp=ra 
print(ra)
