Starting off 
We ask if she wants us to start from the top or just go to the current issue or agenda for the meeting, which is discussing Relu partnership or our own tooth segmentation implementation from models generated by teams on competitions.
we give our agenda, which is right now
- First establishing current progress, where we are, what we know, the general idea/main parts.
- Then we deliver where we are stuck/risks.
- Then we provide possible solutions.
- First is Relu partnership, for this we know that Relu is a product that is developed by Relu BV and it's in early stages and is being developed specifically to solve the problems we faced. It has a platform, a team behind it and it's developed by https://www.relu.ai/about-relu these guys and some other details (Fill them in).
- Then we discuss what we have learnt so far and what they have said and how they fit into us.
- Next our risks with them, such as a steeper price (unknown but it can be costly, put an estimate here).
- Secondly they don't have an implementation for us yet, but that's something that will develop later on. So what is needed for this implementation to get started, and what they need from us are things we need to lay out.
- Thirdly, how will the partnership look like, how long will they support us and if there will be renewals and so on. And vendor lock in, do they have something like that or requirements from us apart from technical ones.
- Next an alternative, our own cloud hosted models. 
- The benefits: All data with us, price can be quite lower as we pay for what we use and flexibility if the solutions aren't great.
- The downsides: We have to look after the development or upgrades ourself, there will be no updates to the models or internals, if there is some issue deep in the segmentation, then the only fix would be to have a dedicated AI developer to look after that or we will have to find some other model/technique/tool.
- We can discuss which approach to use, when, and when should we connect with Relu, if decided.
