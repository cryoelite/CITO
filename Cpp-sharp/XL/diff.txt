Objective: Implement Git Diff for Excel Workbooks, which would diff the worksheet names, data and styles and VBA class modules.

Possible ways:
1. Use ExcelJS (MIT License) which can import/export worksheet data across different formats (xls* to csv and back)
2. Use xlwings/git-xl (MIT License) or plaintext for VBA files in a workbook to diff 
3. Use NPOI (Apache 2.0 License) or plain Microsoft Office Interop in .net to export data, for each workbook's worksheet create a file such as in .json, with all its data and styles.
For ex.:

In a "sheet1.json"
{
    "sheetName": "sheet1",
    "cells": [
        {
            "cellId": "01",
            "cellData": {
                "CellType": "something",
                "style": {
                "someProp": "someValue"
                }
            },
        },
        {
            "cellId": "02",
            "cellData": {
                "CellType": "something",
                "style": {
                "someProp": "someValue"
                }
            },
        }
    ]
}
